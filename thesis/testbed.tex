This chapter presents the hardware testbed. The assembled, setup system is
capable of dynamically adjusting its computational load relative to the on-site
energy production by photo-voltaic (PV) modules. Section
\ref{sec:hardware_components} lists all main physical components. Section
\ref{sec:hardware_assembly} shows the assembly of all components and explains
their interrelations. Subsequently section \ref{sec:software_setup} shows the
software setup, necessary to ensure functionality of the components, data
transmission and operability.  Section
\ref{sec:implementation_of_energy-aware_resource_management} presents the
implementation of Energy-Aware Resource Management for this testbed and
demonstrates the conformity with the requirements from section
\ref{sec:testbed_requirements}.

\section{Hardware Components}
\label{sec:hardware_components}

The testbed is mainly composed of the following hardware. As the compute node,
the single-board computer \emph{Raspberry Pi 3b+} serves as a viable choice due
to its low energy consumption, cost effectiveness and wide range of hardware
applications.\footnote{\url{https://raspberrypi.com}} Renewable energy is
produced by four PV modules, each generating 330 mA at 6 V as stated by its
manufacturer. Excess energy produced by the PV modules is stored in a 3.7 V,
6600 mAh lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery as backup energy source in case of
suboptimal solar conditions. Ultimately a component, connecting all components
listed above, is needed to measure the energy production of the PV modules and
the energy consumption of the compute node. \emph{SwitchDoc Labs} developed
\emph{SunControl}, an inexpensive solar power controller board, among multiple
other things capable of these tasks \cite{switchdoc_suncontrol} and is therefore
ideal for this testbed.

\section{Hardware Assembly}
\label{sec:hardware_assembly}

\section{Software Setup}
\label{sec:software_setup}

As the testbed is meant to be self-sufficient, remote communication is most
suitable for monitoring and operations. A Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the
Raspberry Pi is easily configured alongside the installation process of
Raspberry Pi OS Lite via their imager
software.\footnote{\url{https://raspberrypi.com/software/}} To enable
functionality of SunControl, installation of SwitchDoc's Python driver code
libraries are necessary. The official code from 2017 was written in Python
2.7.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/switchdoclabs/SDL_Pi_SunControl}} Since
Python 2 is deprecated since 2020 and vital official libraries are no longer
supported,\footnote{\url{https://python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/}} the codebase
needed to be refactored and ported from Python 2.7 to
3.7.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/marvin-steinke/SDL_Pi_SunControl}} To
allow SunControl to communicate with the Raspberry Pi, Inter-Integrated Circuit
(I$^2$C) support for the ARM core and Linux kernel need to be
enabled.\footnote{\label{footnote:config}\url{https://github.com/marvin-steinke/bachelors_thesis/blob/master/src/config/config.txt}}

\subsection{Energy Preservation}

The Raspberry Pi has many components, some of which might not be needed for the
specific use-cases of the testbed, but still make up a large portion of overall
energy consumption. The Bluetooth and HDMI module and the USB ports can be
disabled to preserve
energy.\footref{footnote:config}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/marvin-steinke/bachelors_thesis/blob/master/src/config/rc.local}}
Figure \ref{fig:idle} displays the idle power usage of the Raspberry Pi 3b+ over
the span of two minutes with the three components enabled and disabled
respectively. Enabling the components yields in an average energy consumption of
\mbox{2.1 W}, while disabling them results in an average consumption of just
\mbox{0.93 W}, preserving \mbox{1.17 W} in total. Since these components serve
no purpose in this version of the testbed, they are disabled in order to
preserve energy.

\section{Implementation of Energy-Aware Resource Management}
\label{sec:implementation_of_energy-aware_resource_management}

Because the CPU is the main consumer of energy in the Raspberry Pi, scaling the
voltage and frequency of the CPU to control its consumption is the most viable
approach to control total energy consumption.
%the frequency and voltage of the Raspberry Pi's ARM CPU can be scaled
%dynamically with the \texttt{cpufreq}
%subsystem\footnote{\url{https://community.arm.com/oss-platforms/w/docs/528/cpufreq-dvfs}}.

\subsection{Scaling the Output of the PV Modules}

The PV modules utilized in this version of the testbed are also distributed by
SwitchDoc Labs. They state that one panel is capable of generating a peak
current of \mbox{330 mA} at \mbox{6
V}.\footnote{\url{https://switchdoc.com/2016/06/solar-panel-comparison-sunlight-test/}}
However, even while testing under strong sunlight, the modules were only capable
of generating a third of the current that is stated. In figure \ref{fig:load} it
can be observed that four of these PV modules would roughly only be capable of
supplying the necessary current to the Raspberry Pi clocked at \mbox{400 MHz},
the lowest possible clock frequency. With this current supplied, there is no
margin for adjusting the energy consumption of the compute node to the
production of the PV modules, as the clock speed could never surpass \mbox{400
MHz}. Therefore to ensure an environment, in which the whole spectrum of energy
consumed by the compute node at different frequencies can be supplied in theory,
measured currents generated by the PV modules are multiplied by the factor
three. Since the currents are still measured and reacted to in real time, the
requirements for a testbed are still met, as presented in section
\ref{sec:testbeds_emulations_and_simulations}.
